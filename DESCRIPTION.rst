The **python-iamge-complete** package allows you to check for various
image types to check whether the image is complete or not. For doing
this, it looks for EOF (end of file) markers in the files or compares
the stored file length against the actual file length.

Supported file formats:

* BMP (extension: .bmp)
* GIF (extension: .gif)
* JPG (extension: .jpg, .jpeg)
* PNG (extension: .png)
* WebP (extension: .webp)
